            beautiful mountainous region in the center-west of
            Colombia is enjoying one of its most beautiful periods

            During many years, COMFAMA has been the glue for 
            Antioquia's many businesses, providing services to 
            their employees and allowing them to enjoy several 
            benefits that did not have before at reasonable 
            prices. This was, of course, an excellent way into
            everyone's hearts.
            
            And yet, an unseen enemy has threated COMFAMA's
            continued welldoing for the middle class: desertion. 
            
            Since 2017, COMFAMA has noted that different kinds
            of microbusinesses have been withdrawing, and it is
            certainly counter-intuitive that anyone would leave
            COMFAMA on its own. But then, why would any business
            finish this beautiful relationship? And more
            importantly, is it possible to predict if anyone is
            about to break-up with COMFAMA? What can be those
            signals that alert a possible withdrawal?
            
            That's where *we* come in. Our story is not 
            important, for the time being. We are four different
            people, gathered together by destiny (and DS4A, of 
            course) in an working group to help COMFAMA, the
            microbusinesses,and Antioquia. We're here to 
            understand the behavior of data and to predict 
            dropouts before they occur. We have a fierce will,
            lots of knowledge acquired during and before DS4A,
            and a strong desire to see this project through.
            We are Team 104.

            describe the relationship between microbusinesses
            of all Antioquia who are affiliated to COMFAMA. For
            these, we can observe three kinds of variables:
            
            1. Categorical variables: such as our dependent 
            variable (*Estado*) to check if they have retired 
            or not, Economic sector, Municipality.
            
            2. Continuous variables: Integers or rational 
            numbers concerning variables such as contributions 
            paid to COMFAMA, subsidies paid to he microbusiness,
            number of workers, number of affiliated months,
            etc.
            
            3. Others: such as retirement dates and
            microbusiness ID.
            
            Before jumping to any conclusion about our model,
            we will look at the behavior of this data to
